# Santa

This project displays a graphical window that allows for input of a kids name, their prefered present, and whether they are
naughty or nice. If they are naughty they get coal, like they deserve.

It stores this information in a variety of lists for further use by Santa Inc, and proprietary companies with plausable use for your children's info.

Implimentation of displaying "SantasLists" is unnecessary due to Santa's magical computer science skills that are misunderstood by mortal professors at OU.
